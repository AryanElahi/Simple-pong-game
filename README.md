# 🏓 Simple Pong Game using Python 🐍 with Turtle 🐢

Welcome to the **Simple Pong Game**! This is a beginner-friendly project designed to introduce teenagers to the basics of Python programming. It was developed as a final project in a Python programming course. The game features two-player action, where players control paddles to hit the ball back and forth in classic Pong style.

## 🎮 How to Play

- **Players**: This game is designed for **two players**, each representing a team:
  - **Left Player (Aqua Team)**: Uses the `Up` and `Down` arrow keys to control their paddle.
  - **Right Player (Red Team)**: Uses the `W` and `S` keys to move their paddle.
  
- **Objective**: Hit the ball with your paddle and try to prevent it from going off the screen on your side. If the ball passes your paddle, your opponent scores a point.

## 🧑‍💻 Getting Started

To play the game on your local machine, follow these simple steps:

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have **Python** installed on your computer. You can download it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

You'll also need the `turtle` library, which comes pre-installed with Python.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository** to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/pong-game.git
    cd pong-game
    ```

2. **Run the game**:
    ```bash
    python pong.py
    ```

### Controls

| Player   | Move Up | Move Down |
|----------|---------|-----------|
| Left     | `↑`     | `↓`       |
| Right    | `W`     | `S`       |

### Features

- Classic **Pong-style gameplay** with simple controls.
- Two teams: **Aqua** (Left) and **Red** (Right).
- **Real-time scoring** for each player.
- A great starting point for those new to Python!
